							<h1>About Excell Resource</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>

							<p>Excell Resource Limitedtd was founded in the year 2015, to improve the
								quality of living of marginalised people within the community and over
								the years, has extended its professional support to both the education
								and social care industry.</p>

							<p>As a specialist tutor, I have extensive experience working in higher
								education. I possess over 25 years of experience working in the health
								and social care sector and have a background in teaching and human
								resource management.</p>

							<p>I previously worked as an assessor for NCFE - Level 2 certificates in
								autism before embarking as a specialist tutor in higher education in 2016.

							<p>I have worked with a wide range of neurodiverse children and adults in a
								variety of settings, including those with specific learning difficulties/
								differences such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)
								autism, dyslexia, Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), complex needs, and mental health by promoting their independent living.</p>

							<p>My first teaching job was with the National Autistic Society as a
								specialist mentor and study skills tutor, where my passion grew more in
								promoting learning and development, having realised I had helped many
								people to achieve their dreams and maximise their potential in areas of
								employment, education, and health and wellbeing.</p>	

							<p>I hold a master' in Critical Autism Studies, a PGCE, a BSc in
								development studies, pg cert in business management.</p>

							<p>I have always had a passion for giving back and helping the society. Let's work together to keep creating brighter futures today!</p>
