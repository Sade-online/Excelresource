							<h1>About Us</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>

							<p>Hello, I'm Anne! Welcome to Excell Resource. We are an independent Mentor and Tutor/ Specialist Support Provider for clients across The UK.</p>

							<p>Excell Resource Limited was founded in 2015, to <strong>improve the quality of living of marginalised people within the community.</strong> Over the years, we have extended our professional support to the education and social care industry.</p>

							<p>As a specialist tutor, I have extensive experience working in higher education. I possess over 25 years of experience working in the health and social care sector and have a background in teaching and human resource management.</p>

							<p> <strong>I previously worked as an assessor for NCFE - Level 2 certificates in autism before embarking as a specialist tutor in higher education in 2016.</strong></p>

							<p><strong>I have worked with a wide range of neurodiverse children and adults in a variety of settings, including those with specific learning difficulties/ differences such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), autism, dyslexia, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), complex needs, and mental health by promoting their independent living.</strong> </p>

							<p>My first teaching job was with the National Autistic Society as a specialist mentor and study skills tutor, where my passion grew in promoting learning and development, having realised <strong>I had helped many people achieve their dreams and maximise their potential in employment, education, and health and wellbeing.</strong></p>	

							<p>I hold a Masters degree in Critical Autism Studies, a PGCE, a BSc in development studies, and a PGCert in business management.</p>

							<p>I have always had a passion for giving back and helping society. Let's work together to keep creating brighter futures today.</p>


							<h1>Why Choose Us?</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>My strategy is <strong>inclusive, holistic, and person-centered, tailored to meet individual needs and requirements. </strong> I integrate the SPELL framework, which emphasises the importance of creating low arousal and a calm environment in different contexts.</p>

							<p>I recognise the uniqueness and differences on the spectrum, so I work according to unique learning preferences. I Use the GROW Model of Coaching and Mentoring, and other evidence-based practice models.</p>

							<h2>How I work with learners</h2>
							<p>I work withlearners on a 1-1 basis via skype/zoom, face-to-face, weekly, or fortnightly, depending on identified needs. I offer an initial session in a confidential and friendly manner, focusing on meeting learning expectations, assessing needs, gathering relevant information, discussing immediate concerns, and making individual learning plan agreements, contracts and policy requirements. Sessions are booked immediately funding and grants are confirmed.</p>
